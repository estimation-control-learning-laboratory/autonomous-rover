This is a 4 mecanum wheel robot car with an IMU sensor, an onboard GPS, and 4 wheel encoders that measure and publish live car states (Position and orienattion).
The goal is to develop a controller to automate several features: path following by using position sensing and correction.
It uses the Arduino GIGA as the main processor and the Arduino NANO IoT 33 as the Bleutooth module for connecting to the PS4 controller for manual mode.
